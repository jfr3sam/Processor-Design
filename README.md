# Processor-Design Project

## Introduction
This project involves designing and testing a processor architecture. It includes assembly language tests to validate the functionality of the processor's instruction set. The project is structured around several `.circ` files, indicating a circuit design component, and a testing assembly file for verifying processor operations.

## Technology Used
- **Assembly Language**: For writing low-level code to directly control the processor's operations. The specific type of assembly language and architecture (e.g., MIPS, ARM) would be named here.
- **Circuit Simulator**: The `.circ` files suggest the use of a circuit design or simulation tool, such as Logisim or a similar program, for creating and testing processor circuits.
- **Document Processing**: Documentation is provided in a `.docx` format, likely created with Microsoft Word or a compatible word processor.

## Setup
1. **Prerequisites**: List of software and hardware prerequisites.
2. **Installation**: Steps to install and configure necessary tools and environments.
3. **Running Tests**: Instructions on how to use the `.asm` file for testing with the designed processor or simulation environment.

## Usage
Describe how someone might use this project, including how to run simulations, test the processor design, or modify the circuit files.
