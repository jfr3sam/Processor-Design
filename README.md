# Processor-Design Project

## Introduction
This project involves designing and testing a processor architecture. It includes assembly language tests to validate the functionality of the processor's instruction set. The project is structured around several `.circ` files, indicating a circuit design component, and a testing assembly file for verifying processor operations.

## Technology Used
- **Assembly Language**: For writing low-level code to directly control the processor's operations. The specific type of assembly language and architecture (e.g., MIPS, ARM) would be named here.
- **Circuit Simulator**: The `.circ` files suggest the use of a circuit design or simulation tool, such as Logisim or a similar program, for creating and testing processor circuits.
- **Document Processing**: Documentation is provided in a `.docx` format, likely created with Microsoft Word or a compatible word processor.

## Setup
1. **Prerequisites**: List of software and hardware prerequisites.
2. **Installation**: Steps to install and configure necessary tools and environments.
3. **Running Tests**: Instructions on how to use the `.asm` file for testing with the designed processor or simulation environment.

## Usage
To use the Processor Design project, follow these steps:

1. **Open Circuit Files**: Open the `.circ` files using the specified circuit simulator. These files represent the processor's circuit design and its variations. You can view and edit the circuit components and understand how the processor is designed to work.
2. **Load Assembly Tests**: Use the `Testing.asm` file to test the processor design. This file contains a series of assembly instructions that should be compatible with the designed processor. Load it into an appropriate simulator or an assembler that can process this architecture's instructions.
3. **Run Simulations**: Execute the circuit simulations while the assembly test is loaded to see how the processor handles different instructions. Observe outputs, behavior, and any potential issues with the design.

## Contributing
Contributions to the Processor Design project are welcome! If you have suggestions, improvements, or want to add features, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Discuss Changes**: Open an issue to discuss any significant changes or enhancements you want to make. This ensures that your efforts align with the project's direction and that duplication of work is avoided.
2. **Fork and Branch**: Fork the repository and make your changes in a new branch. This makes it easier to manage contributions.
3. **Code Standards**: Ensure your code adheres to the existing style and standards. Include comments and documentation as needed.
4. **Pull Requests**: Once you're ready, submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes and any other relevant information for review.
